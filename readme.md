# Happy 2 Help

Happy 2 Help facilitates the communication and organization of volunteer work. Non-profit organizations are given the opportunity to easily publish events and jobs they wish to get help for. Volunteers may apply for these jobs to announce their willingness to help. This makes volunteering more accessible and manageable.
Via the application event creators can also confirm a volunteer's participation, who is then granted a certain amount of credit points. With these a user is allowed to create his own events to ask for help for everyday tasks and problems.

Some app features:
- event locations and map view
- image upload
- user profiles with credit points and skills
- organisation profiles with admin and member support
- QR code check-in
- search and filter options for events
- language localisation
